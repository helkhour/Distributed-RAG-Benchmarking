## Trade-Offs
- **Precision vs. Latency**: thenlper/gte-base (96.48%, ~123ms) offers top precision with low latency, ideal for research. all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (93.38%, ~75ms) prioritizes speed, suitable for interactive tools. Llama-3.1-8B (56.67%, ~629ms) is unsuitable.
- **Throughput vs. Memory**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~51 QPS, ~3.7GB) is resource-efficient, while mxbai models (~17-18 QPS, ~4.0-4.5GB) demand more memory, limiting scalability.
- **Embedding Time vs. Database Size**: Smaller embeddings (gte-base-384: ~70.74 MB, ~41s batch) enhance efficiency. Larger embeddings (Llama-3.1-8B: ~746 MB, ~729s) are costly.
- **Batch vs. Sequential**: Batch mode reduces embedding time (e.g., ~41s vs. ~129s for gte-base-384) with minimal impact on retrieval, preferred for research.

## Candidate Impact
Increasing candidates from 30 to 100 improves precision (e.g., +0.04% for gte-base-384, +1.08% for mxbai-512) with minimal latency (~0.6-1.8ms faster) and throughput (~0.1-0.3 QPS higher) impact. For research, 30 candidates often suffice, but 100 candidates offer marginal gains.

## Cost per Embedding

## Recommendations
- **Maximize Precision**: thenlper/gte-base (96.48%) for academic literature search.
- **Minimize Latency**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~75ms) for real-time question answering.
- **Optimize Resources**: thenlper/gte-base-384 (~3.7GB, ~70.74 MB) for constrained environments.
- **Efficient Indexing**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~14.71s batch) for frequent updates.
- **Storage Efficiency**: mxbai-embed-large-v1-256 (~48.83 MB) for minimal storage.
- **Avoid**: Llama-3.1-8B due to poor precision and high resource demands.
